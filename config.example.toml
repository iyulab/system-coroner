# Baseline — declare known-good artifacts on this host so they are not flagged as threats.
# coroner auto-detects its own binary directory and output directory.
# Add additional paths, accounts, or processes that are expected/legitimate in your environment.
[baseline]
# known_paths are directory prefixes for trusted tools or operator infrastructure.
# Any collected artifact whose path starts with one of these values will be annotated
# as known-good so the LLM does not treat it as an attack artifact.
# Example: known_paths = ["D:\\monitoring\\agent", "C:\\ops\\tools"]
# known_paths = []

# known_accounts are local account names that are legitimate and expected on this host.
# Example: known_accounts = ["backup_svc", "monitoring_agent"]
# known_accounts = []

# known_processes are executable filenames (without path) that are known-good.
# Example: known_processes = ["backup.exe", "agent.exe"]
# known_processes = []
